------------> FUNKIT CATCHBALL <-------------

Game Description:

This is a two player game. One player throws/shoots a ball to the other side, where the second player tries to catch the ball.
Initally, the players decide if they would like to shoot ('S') or catch first ('C'). The first player to confirm their choice 
enforces their choice on the other player. The game then starts. The shooter/thrower can move left and right with the navswitch. 
To throw a ball, the shooter presses the navswitch down. The catcher can move left and right to catch the ball.There also is a 15% 
chance of a sudden 'wind gust' blowing the ball to the left or the right. This makes the game more challenging. Once 12 balls have been thrown, 
the roles are reversed and the old catcher can now throw the ball 12 times. After that, the winner and loser are determined. 
The player that has caught the most balls wins!
